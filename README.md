# heartdisease
This database contains 76 attributes, but all published experiments refer to using a subset of 14 of them. In particular, the Cleveland database is the only one that has been used by ML researchers to this date. The "goal" field refers to the presence of heart disease in the patient. It is integer valued from 0 (no presence) to 4.
              This project is used to find whether the patient is having heart disease or not based on properties.
Here we are using Supervised machine Learning Techniques to solve the dataset.In Supervised machine Learning we are using Classification Algorithms to solve the dataset.
In classification we are using Algorithms like logisticRegression, KNeighbours,GaussianNaÃ¯veByes,Decision tree,Random Forest.And we finding confession matrices and accuracy scores fo each algorithm.And we are checking which algorithm is giving best accuracy and we will prefer that algorithm in future to find Heart Disease.

 The names and social security numbers of the patients were recently removed from the database, replaced with dummy values.
